## Prerequisites to run locally

The project is using `make`. `make` is typically installed by default on Linux and Mac.
`make` is not strictly required, but it helps and documents commonly used commands.

If you run on Windows, you can directly install it from [gnuwin32](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or via `winget`

```PowerShell
winget install GnuWin32.Make
```

Run `make init` to install all dependencies in a virtual Python environment.

### How to Use

You can check all `make` commands by running.

```bash
make help
```
